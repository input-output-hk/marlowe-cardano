-- | Using the blockly events, detect when the contract has changed and fire a halogen message.
-- |
-- | There are two events that signal us that the contract has changed.
-- |   * When the Change event is fired (which means that a property inside a block has changed)
-- |   * When the Move event is fired and the old and new parent are different (which means that
-- |     a block has been attached/detached)
-- |
-- | We also need to track the UI events to see if we are in the middle of a drag-n-drop.
-- | When we attach a block into a new parent there is no problem, but when we detach a block there
-- | is a small inconsistency.
-- | When we start draging a block outside from its parent, Blockly will fire the Move event and let us
-- | believe that the contract has changed. But if we ask Blockly to generate the contract at that point,
-- | the result will include the block we just detached. So we need to accumulate the events fired during
-- | drag-n-drop and analyze them once we drop it.
