## Added

- Assets to several response schemas
  - In `Payout` - shows the assets in the tx output corresponding to the payout.

  - In `Tx` - shows the assets in the marlowe script output of that transaction (the account balances). Empty if the transaction does not produce an output.
- Payouts produced by a transaction are added to `Tx`

- More details displayed about internal server errors

- Tokens json objects are deserialized now without the `unTokens` field.

<a id='changelog-0.0.2'></a>
# 0.0.2 — 2023-06-15

## Added

* These endpoints `POST` handlers were extended so they return transaction as a result (instead of transaction body) if a particular header is present:

  * `contracts` endpoint uses "Accept: application/vendor.iog.marlowe-runtime.contract-tx-json" header

  * `transactions` endpoint uses "Accept: application/vendor.iog.marlowe-runtime.apply-inputs-tx-json" header

  * `withdraw` endpoint uses "Accept: application/vendor.iog.marlowe-runtime.withdraw-tx-json" header

* All the above endpoints accept also `witnessset` as a payload for `PUT` request now.
