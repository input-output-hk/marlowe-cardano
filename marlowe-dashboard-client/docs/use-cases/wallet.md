## Create a new testnet wallet
**NOT IMPLEMENTED YET**
#### UC-WALLET-TESTNET-1

Allow a user to create a new wallet in a centralized server connected to the testnet. This helps users to try marlowe contracts in Marlowe Run without having to install a wallet.

## Restore a testnet wallet
#### UC-WALLET-TESTNET-2

With the use of a mnemonic phrase the user can retrieve the wallet created in `UC-WALLET-TESTNET-1` in the centralized server.

**IMPORTANT!!!: ** The user should never use a mnemonic phrase from a real mainnet wallet.
