# Marlowe Runtime Documentation

Marlowe Runtime is the application backend for managing Marlowe contracts. It provides easy-to-use, higher-level APIs (application programming interfaces) and complete backend services that enable developers to build and deploy enterprise and Web(3) (D)app solutions using Marlowe, but without having to assemble “plumbing” that manually orchestrates a backend workflow for a Marlowe-based application.


![Usages of Marlowe Runtime](diagrams/usages.jpg)

Runtime provides developers access to the off-chain logic required to run Marlowe contracts and track their progress. This involves querying information about contracts, discovering contracts, reading the history and state of a contract, and subscribing to live contract updates. It also involves interacting with contracts: creating new contracts, applying contract inputs, and withdrawing funds paid out to a party.

Developers of Web3 DApps who run Marlowe contracts can use the Marlowe Runtime as a backend service to create, run, and inspect contracts easily. The Marlowe Runtime will allow developers to actively collect data, monitor and notify about contract changes on the blockchain. Such a feature is necessary when integrating with the end-user interface. For example, it allows for displaying any prompts or error messages on the user interface, so that the user can take action, which will be then sent to the blockchain via Runtime, without the use of low-level tools.

Knowledge of Haskell or Plutus is not required for developers to communicate with Runtime. Communication with Runtime over REST and/or WebSocket APIs is language-agnostic, so developers can use a language of their choice (e.g., Python, JavaScript, or Rust). However, the Runtime backend can interact directly with Haskell-based clients.



## Architecture

The backend for Marlowe runtime consists of a chain-indexing and query service (`marlowe-chain-indexer` / `marlowe-chain-sync`), a contract-indexing and query service for Marlowe contracts (`marlowe-indexer` / `marlowe-sync`), and a transaction-creation service for Marlowe contracts (`marlowe-tx`). These backend services operate in concert and rely upon [cardano-node](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/blob/master/README.rst) for blockchain connectivity and upon [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) for persistent storage. Access to the backend services is provided via a command-line client (`marlowe`), an AWS Lambda function (`marlowe-lambda`), or a REST/WebSocket server (`web-server`) that uses JSON payloads. Web applications can integrate with a [CIP-30 light wallet](https://cips.cardano.org/cips/cip30/) for transaction signing, whereas enterprise applications can integrate with [cardano-wallet](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-wallet/blob/master/README.md), [cardano-cli](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/blob/master/cardano-cli/README.md), or [cardano-hw-cli](https://github.com/vacuumlabs/cardano-hw-cli/blob/develop/README.md) for signing transactions.

## Backend Services

The backend services for use typed protocols over TCP sockets, with ports separate by concerns (i.e., control, query, and synchronization). Each service handles rollbacks via the use of intersection points that reference specific slots/blocks on the blockchain. Most of the data flow is stream-oriented and the services are as stateless as possible. The information flow within the backend maximizes the node as the single source of truth, thus minimizing the danger of downstream components receiving inconsistent information. The Haskell types in the client API for Runtime Clients are decoupled from dependencies upon the numerous Cardano packages for the ledger, node, plutus, etc., so that a Haskell client for Runtime has very few Runtime or Cardano dependencies in its `.cabal` file.

See the [tutorial for the Marlowe Runtime command-line-interface](tutorial.md) or the [deployment instructions for the Marlowe Runtime backend](deployment.md) for more information.


### Chain Sync Daemon

The `marlowe-chain-sync` executable provides services for querying the blockchain for information that may relate to Marlowe contracts. It manages and updates partitioned PostgreSQL tables for all blocks, transactions, inputs, outputs, and assets on the blockchain, not just for Marlowe transactions. It handles rollbacks in the blockchain. It syncs from the genesis block rapidly for test networks like `preprod` and `preview`, but currently takes about 15 hours to sync from the genesis of `mainnet`.

Three APIs, accessible over three different TCP sockets, are provided:
- The *job* API provides one function:
	- Submit a transaction to the local Cardano node.
- The *query* API provides two functions:
	- Query the local state of the Cardano node for information such as the system start time, the protocol parameters, or the slotting.
	- Get the unspent UTxOs.
- The *sync* API streams or replays the block and transaction information from the Cardano node.

See `marlowe-chain-sync`'s [help page](marlowe-chain-sync.md) or its [deployment instructions](../../marlowe-chain-sync/ReadMe.md) for more information.


### Marlowe Transaction

The `marlowe-tx` executable provides services related to building and submitting transactions for Marlowe contracts. It uses `marlowe-chain-sync` to gather the information needed to create and apply inputs to Marlowe contract instances. It also communicates with the Cardano node to submit transactions after they have been signed.

There are three categories of Marlowe transactions on the blockchain:
- The creation of a new Marlowe contract.
- The application of zero or more inputs to a Marlowe contract:
	- Deposit funds.
	- Make a choice.
	- Notify the contract to check a condition.
- The withdrawal of funds paid out by the contract, in cases where the funds are paid to a Marlowe *role* instead of a public-key-hash address.

The UTxO diagrams below show the typical patterns of inputs and outputs in the three categories of Marlowe transactions. The `marlowe-tx` service constructs transactions according to the constraints of the Marlowe language, the funds available in the wallet, and the state of the ledger.

| Creation | Application of Inputs (Deposit, Choose, Notify, Timeout) | Withdrawal of Funds Paid |
|---|---|---|
| ![A typical transaction that creates a Marlowe contract](diagrams/create.svg) | ![A typical transaction that applies inputs to a Marlowe contract](diagrams/apply-inputs.svg) | ![A typical transaction that withdraws funds paid out by a Marlowe contract](diagrams/redeem.svg) |

The *command* API, accessible over a TCP socket, provides the following capabilities:
- Build the creation transaction for a Marlowe contract.
- Build an input-application transaction for a contract instance.
- Build a withdrawal transaction for a Marlowe payout.
- Submit a transaction to the Cardano node.

See `marlowe-tx`'s [help page](marlowe-tx.md) for more information.


## Command-Line Interface

The `marlowe` executable provides a command-line interface to interacting with Marlowe Runtime services. All communication is via TCP sockets with a Haskell-centric serialization format. It can be used to discover, query, create, apply inputs, withdraw, or submit Marlowe transactions. Note that it does not support private-key management and it defers signing to external tools such as [cardano-wallet](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-wallet/blob/master/README.md), [cardano-cli](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/blob/master/cardano-cli/README.md), or [cardano-hw-cli](https://github.com/vacuumlabs/cardano-hw-cli/blob/develop/README.md).

See `marlowe-tx`'s various [help pages](marlowe-tx.md) for more information, or the tutorial for Marlowe runtime [as a Jupyter notebook](tutorial.ipynb) or in [markdown format](tutorial.md). There are more examples [here](../examples/).

## AWS Lambda Interface

The Marlowe Runtime client for AWS Lambda is documented in a separate repository, [`marlowe-lambda`](https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-lambda). In brief, it enables users to create, apply inputs to, and withdraw funds from Marlowe contract instances; it also lets them list all of the Marlowe contracts on the blockchain and to examine their on-chain status and contents.


## Web Services

*The development of Marlowe Runtime web services is an ongoing work in progress.*
