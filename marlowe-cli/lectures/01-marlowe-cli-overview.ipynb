    "# Overview of Marlowe CLI\n",

    "This lecture provides an introduction to the `marlowe-cli` tool, which allows one to create and interact with Marlowe contracts on the blockchain. It summarizes uses of the tool, the levels at which it can interact with Marlowe on the blockchain, and how Marlowe transactions relate to the Cardano's eUTxO model."

    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "The `marlowe-cli` tool enables developers to submit transactions and interact from the command line with Marlowe contracts on the Cardano blockchain, just as the `cardano-cli` tool has enabled them to do so for plain transactions, simple scripts, and Plutus scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Use Cases***\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Facilitation of internal development and testing of Marlowe contracts.\n",
    "    1.  Measuring transaction size.\n",
    "    2.  Submitting transactions.\n",
    "    3.  Testing wallet integrations.\n",
    "    4.  Debugging validators.\n",
    "2.  Early access to Marlowe capabilities on testnet and mainnet.\n",
    "3.  Integration with external developer’s workflows and toolsets for Marlowe contracts, similar to how the Cardano development community has heavily integrated `cardano-cli` into various services (libraries, faucets, token minting, marketplaces, etc.).\n",
    "4.  Incorporation into training for use of Marlowe."
