# Overview of Marlowe CLI

This lecture provides an introduction to the `marlowe-cli` tool, which
allows one to create and interact with Marlowe contracts on the
blockchain. It summarizes uses of the tool, the levels at which it can
interact with Marlowe on the blockchain, and how Marlowe transactions
relate to the Cardano's eUTxO model.

</div>

<div class="cell markdown" jp-MarkdownHeadingCollapsed="true" tags="[]">

## Purpose

The `marlowe-cli` tool enables developers to submit transactions and
interact from the command line with Marlowe contracts on the Cardano
blockchain, just as the `cardano-cli` tool has enabled them to do so for
plain transactions, simple scripts, and Plutus scripts.

***Use Cases***

1.  Facilitation of internal development and testing of Marlowe
    contracts.
    1.  Measuring transaction size.
    2.  Submitting transactions.
    3.  Testing wallet integrations.
    4.  Debugging validators.
2.  Early access to Marlowe capabilities on testnet and mainnet.
3.  Integration with external developer’s workflows and toolsets for
    Marlowe contracts, similar to how the Cardano development community
    has heavily integrated `cardano-cli` into various services
    (libraries, faucets, token minting, marketplaces, etc.).
4.  Incorporation into training for use of Marlowe.

| • Supports developer workflows for debugging and fine-grained control of each atomic operation involved in running Marlowe contracts. | • Supports a straightforward workflow for users that just want to run contracts from the command line. | • Supports direct interaction with backend contracts and endpoints for running Marlowe from the command line. |
| • Controls modification of Marlowe state and construction of Marlowe input.                                                           | • Hides details of input and state of Marlowe contracts.                                               | • Hides details of UTxO management by interacting with a Cardano Wallet or Daedalus.                          |
| • Controls construction and submission of validators, datums, and redeemers.                                                          | • Hides and automates many aspects of Plutus and interaction with the Cardano node.                    | • Mimics the workflow for using Marlowe Run.                                                                  |
| • Focus on the mechanics of Marlowe on Plutus and Cardano.                                                                            | • Focuses on the Marlowe contract.                                                                     | • Focuses on user interaction.                                                                                |

## Review of eUTxO Model

</div>

<div class="cell markdown">

## Marlowe Roles: Currency, Tokens, and Payouts

-   Each Marlowe contract has a currency symbol for its roles and a
    payout validator script for receiving and disbursing payments to
    participants.
-   Participants typically interact with Marlowe contracts by including
    a role token in transactions that the participant authorizes.
    -   Role tokens are a concatenation of the currency symbol and the
        role name as the token name.
-   Participants withdraw funds from a special payout script using their
    role token.
    -   The payout Plutus script is unique to each role currency symbol.
    -   The datum at the payout address is simply the token name for the
        participant that is allowed to spend that UTxO.
    -   The redeemer for spending from the payout script is empty.
-   Roles provide a flexible and secure way for participants to interact
    with Marlowe.
-   Role tokens can be transferred from one wallet to another.

## Merkleization

-   Because the Marlowe Domain-Specific Language (DSL) has limited
    capabilities, primarily for provable safety, Marlowe contracts
    involving many parties or choices may become quiet lengthy.
-   Because the Cardano blockchain protocol parameters limit the size of
    transactions, a lengthy Marlowe contract will not fit in a
    transaction.
-   To alleviate this problem, Marlowe supports a technique called
    "Merkleization" where only the immediately needed part of the
    contract is stored in the contract's most recent transaction on the
    blockchain.
-   The continuation of the contract in `Case` statements is referenced
    securely by the hash of that continuation.
-   When a choice is made that would necessitate executing that
    continuation, it is provided as input to the transaction and the
    Marlowe validator verifies that its hash matches the hash required
    by the on-chain contract.
-   This Merkleization technique can radically reduce the on-chain size
    of a contract from hundreds of megabytes down to less than a
    kilobyte.

<div class="cell markdown">

## Troubleshooting

-   Run the contract in the Marlowe Playground simulator before running
    it at the command line.
-   Pay attention to the timeouts in `When` clauses of a contract:
    -   Does the timeout trigger the intendent movement of funds between
        accounts?
    -   Is the timeout consistent with other timeouts in `Case`
        statements?

## Summary

-   Marlowe CLI can be used at various level of interaction with the
    blockchain.
    -   Run contracts without actually making blockchain transactions.
    -   Submit Marlowe transactions on the blockchain.
        -   At high level, without explicitly using Plutus.
        -   At low level, dealing directly with Plutus constructs.
    -   Interact with the Marlowe Backend.
-   There are three types of Marlowe transactions on the blockchain:
    -   Creating a contract.
    -   Applying inputs to a contract.
    -   Withdrawing funds from the contract's role-payout address.
