-- | This contract is not really practical given the current limitations of Marlowe validator - we are able to handle
-- only few distinct accounts/tokens. It lives here as a baseline for performance testing.
--
-- Contract logic:
-- Given a set of recipients with specific expected `Value` payouts and a single sender
-- construct a contract which will accept deposits (in alphabetical order of (currencySymbol, tokenName)) and then
-- pays out in "chunks" (based on `PayoutChunkSize`) to the recipients.
-- The payouts are chunked because of the on chain limits - the payout loop is suspended and resumed on every
-- payout chunk.
-- The contract is still possibly unsafe because at some point multiple "notifies" can in theory expire so a single
-- trigger can turn into a larger set of payouts which can exceed on chain limits. Because of that we use infinity
-- approximation (+10_000 years) for all the timeouts in the `Notify` constrcuts.
