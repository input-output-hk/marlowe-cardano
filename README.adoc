Marlowe is a platform for financial products as smart contracts. Marlowe-Cardano is
an implementation of Marlowe for the Cardano blockchain, built on top of Plutus.

This repository contains:

* The implementation of the Marlowe domain-specific language.
* Tools for working with Marlowe, including static analysis.
* A selection of examples using Marlowe, including a number based on the ACTUS financial standard.
* The Marlowe Playground, a web-based playground for learning and writing Marlowe Applications.

[[cache-warning]]
[IMPORTANT]
====
DO NOT IGNORE THIS

If you want to use Nix with this project, make sure to set up the xref:iohk-binary-cache[IOHK binary cache].
If you do not do this, you will end up building GHC, which takes several hours.
If you find yourself building GHC, STOP and fix the cache.

== Documentation

=== User documentation

The main documentation for the whole Plutus ecosystem is located https://plutus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[here].

An index of key documentation for Marlowe development is located at https://developers.cardano.org/docs/smart-contracts/marlowe/#resources-for-developing-and-deploying-marlowe-contracts.

== Working with the project

=== How to submit an issue

Issues can be filed in the https://github.com/input-output-hk/marlowe-cardano/issues[GitHub Issue tracker].

However, note that this is pre-release software, so we will not usually be providing support.

[[how-to-develop]]
=== How to develop and contribute to the project

See link:CONTRIBUTING{outfilesuffix}[CONTRIBUTING], which describes our processes in more detail including development environments; and link:ARCHITECTURE{outfilesuffix}[ARCHITECTURE], which describes the structure of the repository.

=== How to depend on the project from another Haskell project

None of our libraries are on Hackage, unfortunately (many of our dependencies aren't either).
So for the time being, you need to:

. Add `marlowe` as a `source-repository-package` to your `cabal.project`.
. Copy the `source-repository-package` stanzas from our `cabal.project` to yours.
. Copy additional stanzas from our `cabal.project` as you need, e.g. you may need some of the `allow-newer` stanzas.

=== How to build the project's artifacts

This section contains information about how to build the project's artifacts for independent usage.
For development work see <<how-to-develop>> for more information.

[[prerequisites]]
==== Prerequisites

The Haskell libraries in the Marlowe project are built with `cabal` and Nix.
The other artifacts (docs etc.) are also most easily built with Nix.

===== Nix

Install https://nixos.org/nix/[Nix] (recommended). following the instructions on the https://nixos.org/nix/[Nix website].

Make sure you have read and understood the xref:cache-warning[cache warning].
DO NOT IGNORE THIS.

See <<nix-advice>> for further advice on using Nix.

===== Non-Nix

You can build some of the Haskell packages without Nix, but this is not recommended and we don't guarantee that these prerequisites are sufficient.
If you use Nix, these tools are provided for you via `nix develop`, and you do *not* need to install them yourself.

* If you want to build our Haskell packages with https://www.haskell.org/cabal/[`cabal`], then install it.
* If you want to build our Haskell packages with https://haskellstack.org/[`stack`], then install it.
* If you want to build our Agda code, then install https://github.com/agda/agda[Agda] and the https://github.com/agda/agda-stdlib[standard library].

[[building-with-nix]]
==== How to build the Haskell packages and other artifacts with Nix

Run `nix build .#ghc8107-marlowe-runtime-lib-marlowe-runtime` from the root to build the Marlowe library.

See <<nix-build-attributes>> to find out what other attributes you can build.

==== How to build the Haskell packages with `cabal`

The Haskell packages can be built directly with `cabal`.
We do this during development (see <<how-to-develop>>).
The best way is to do this is inside a `nix develop`.

[NOTE]
====
For fresh development setups, you also need to run `cabal update`.
====

Run `cabal build marlowe` from the root to build the Marlowe library.

See the link:./cabal.project[cabal project file] to see the other packages that you can build with `cabal`.

[NOTE]
====
If you get errors about missing shared libraries, try running `cabal clean` first. 

If that fails you might have a corrupt cabal store, in which case you should `rm -rf ~/.cabal/store` and try `cabal build all` again.

[[iohk-binary-cache]]
=== How to set up the IOHK binary caches

Adding the IOHK binary cache to your Nix configuration will speed up
builds a lot, since many things will have been built already by our CI.

If you find you are building packages that are not defined in this
repository, or if the build seems to take a very long time then you may
not have this set up properly.

To set up the cache:

. On non-NixOS, edit `/etc/nix/nix.conf` and add the following lines:
+
----
substituters        = https://cache.iog.io https://iohk.cachix.org https://cache.nixos.org/
trusted-public-keys = hydra.iohk.io:f/Ea+s+dFdN+3Y/G+FDgSq+a5NEWhJGzdjvKNGv0/EQ= iohk.cachix.org-1:DpRUyj7h7V830dp/i6Nti+NEO2/nhblbov/8MW7Rqoo= cache.nixos.org-1:6NCHdD59X431o0gWypbMrAURkbJ16ZPMQFGspcDShjY=
----
+
[NOTE]
====
If you don't have an `/etc/nix/nix.conf` or don't want to edit it, you may add the `nix.conf` lines to `~/.config/nix/nix.conf` instead.
You must be a https://nixos.org/nix/manual/#ssec-multi-user[trusted user] to do this.
====
. On NixOS, set the following NixOS options:
+
----
nix.settings = {
  substituters        = [ "https://cache.iog.io" "https://iohk.cachix.org" ];
  trusted-public-keys = [ "hydra.iohk.io:f/Ea+s+dFdN+3Y/G+FDgSq+a5NEWhJGzdjvKNGv0/EQ=" "iohk.cachix.org-1:DpRUyj7h7V830dp/i6Nti+NEO2/nhblbov/8MW7Rqoo=" ];
};
----


=== Nix on macOS

Nix on macOS can be a bit tricky. In particular, sandboxing is disabled by default, which can lead to strange failures.

These days it should be safe to turn on sandboxing on macOS with a few exceptions. Consider setting the following Nix settings, in the same way as in xref:iohk-binary-cache[previous section]:

----
sandbox = true
extra-sandbox-paths = /System/Library/Frameworks /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks /usr/lib /private/tmp /private/var/tmp /usr/bin/env
----

Changes to `/etc/nix/nix.conf` may require a restart of the nix daemon in order to take affect. Restart the nix daemon by running the following commands:

----
sudo launchctl stop org.nixos.nix-daemon
sudo launchctl start org.nixos.nix-daemon
----

[[nix-build-attributes]]
=== Which attributes to use to build different artifacts

link:./packages.nix[`packages.nix`] defines a package set with attributes for all the artifacts you can build from this repository.
These can be built using `nix build`.
For example:

== Docker compose

There is a `docker compose` setup designed to give a local developer mode of the marlowe runtime components,
configured in link:./nix/dev/compose.nix[`compose.nix`].

Currently, this only supports Linux systems.

On Linux, `compose.yaml` will be automatically set up for the user when entering `nix develop`.

Running `nix run .#re-up` will refresh `compose.yaml` if need be and then restart any services which have changed.

Services currently included:

* `marlowe-chain-sync`: `marlowe-chain-sync` for the `preprod` network.
* `marlowe-chain-indexer`: `marlowe-chain-indexer` for the `preprod` network.
* `node`: A node for the `preprod` network.
* `postgres`: A postgres instance, for marlowe-chain-sync state.
* `marlowe--sync`: `marlowe-sync` for the `preprod` network.
* `marlowe--indexer`: `marlowe-indexer` for the `preprod` network.
* `marlowe-tx`: A `marlowe-tx` instance.
* `marlowe-contract`: A `marlowe-contract` instance.
* `marlowe-proxy`: A `marlowe-proxy` instance.
* `web`: A `marlowe-web-server` instance.
* `otel-collector`: A shared `opentelemetry` collector instance for distributed tracing.
* `jaeger`: A trace viewer service.

The following commands may be useful:

* `docker compose exec postgres /exec/run-sqitch`: Run the sqitch migrations for the chain-sync database.
* `docker compose exec postgres psql -U postgres -d chain`: Run psql in the `chain` database.
* `docker compose port`, e.g. `docker compose port web 8080` will show the local port that maps to port `8080` for the `web` service

=== Accessing the node socket:

The node socket file lives inside a Docker volume. Because it is created by the
container, it is owned by root, and needs elevated permissions (via `sudo`) to
use - keep this in mind when using it locally with a tool like `cardano-cli`.

To list your Docker volumes, use the command `docker volume ls`. The socket
lives in the `marlowe-cardano_shared` volume. Use
`docker volume inspect marlowe-cardano_shared` to obtain information about the
volume. The `Mountpoint` property shows the directory on the host machine that
maps to the volume (one-liner: `docker volume inspect marlowe-cardano_shared | jq -r '.[].Mountpoint'`)

To use this with `cardano-cli`:

----
export CARDANO_NODE_SOCKET_PATH=$(docker volume inspect marlowe-cardano_shared | jq -r '.[].Mountpoint')
# -E passes the current environment to sudo
sudo -E cardano-cli ...
